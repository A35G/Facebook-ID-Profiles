Facebook ID Profiles
====================

Using the URL of an image hosted on the social network Facebook, it is possible to trace the profile information that houses it, if these are public.

This is a first versione of this project and is based on [FBid](https://github.com/guelfoweb/fbid "FBid by Gianni 'guelfoweb' Amato") by Gianni 'guelfoweb' Amato
