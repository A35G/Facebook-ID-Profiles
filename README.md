Facebook ID Profiles
====================

Using the URL of an image hosted on the social network Facebook, it is possible to trace the profile information that houses it, if these are public.

This is a first versione of this project and is based on [FBid](https://github.com/guelfoweb/fbid "FBid by Gianni 'guelfoweb' Amato") by Gianni 'guelfoweb' Amato

To test a demo version, always updated in line with the repository, [you can go here](http://gmcode.it/fbid/ "Facebook ID Profiles - beta version - GMCode.it")

**Attention**

If during the test, found the following error:
```
Application request limit reached, OAuthException (# 4)
```
is an error that I'm studying to solve ... wait a few seconds and try again with the same link
